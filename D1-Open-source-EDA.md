# DAY 1 Introduction to open-source EDA, OpenLANE and SKY130PDK

List of Topics being covered

1. How to talk to computers
2. SOC design and OpenLANE
3. Open-source EDA tools

Before getting started, let us talk about what is physical design.

   Physical design is the process of transforming a gate level netlist into a physical layout which is manufacturable. This process starts with partitioning of the design followed by floor/power planning, placement of standard cells, clock tree synthesis and routing. 
                   
**Partitioning :** Dividing the design into smaller parts called macros. In this similar functional blocks are located closed to eachother inorder to minimize the connections between the macros.

**Floor planning :** The most critical step in physical design flow. Quality of the chip depends on how good the floorplan is. In this stage we will get to know the shape and size of the die by the aspect ratio and utilization factor. Placement of Macros is done using Macro guide lines. After macros, halos/blockages, I/O pins and pre placed cells are placed.

**power planning :** Inorder to supply power equally to each and every cell in our design, a power grid has been created where power is drawn from the supply to power rings then to stripes and finally through rails to the standard cells.

**Placement :** Here all the standard cells are placed inside the core. By coarse placement, standard cells which are in the modules gets placed roughly in the core and overlapped. In detailed placement, cells sit in the site rows in abutted manner and blockages/ halos help in non-overlapping and congestion.

**Clock Tree Synthesis:** In a sequentinal design, Clock is the main component. Clock is ideal till placement. The main goal of CTS is to propagate the clock to each and every clock sinks with min skew and insertion delay by inserting clock buffers and inverters along the clock path. Clock Balancing is done by H tree methodology inorder to meet timing and power. 

**Routing :** It is connecting the cells physically using metal straps. In this stage actual interconnect delays will be known. Before this stage, connections are logical i.e., trail route has been done. Once detailed routing is done, the design is checked for DRC,LVS. 
Once verification is done, The output of this PnR i.e., GDSII is given to Fabrication team.

Now, lets talk about the list of topics.

# HOW TO TALK TO COMPUTERS.

## QFN-48 PAckage, Foundary IPS and Macros

 QFN-48  Package : Quad flat No Lead 48 package is an IC component best used for proagrammable module and microcomputers with 7 x 7mm body width and 48pins and these pins are driven by the board which is being seated. The Chip sits in the center of the Package. Package is like a case that surrounds the chip to protect it from corrosion or physical damage.

The Chip has various components.

1. Die  : Size of the entire chip and area where I/O pads sit.
2. Pads : Signals travel through pads in and out of the chip.
3. Core : Area in which Macros, standard cells sit and routing happens.

**FOUNDARY** is a factory where chip gets manufatcured. Every information related to to chip depends on this. It is a set of machines where engineers can communicate with factory. **IPS** is **intellectual property** because these blocks need some intelligence to be built and are manufactured using foundry. Hence together called Foundary IPs.

**Macros** are reusable pieces of logic blocks (Intellectual Properties), that can be used in a design without the necessity of building them from scratch. These are like block box.

##  RISC-V Instruction set Architecture (ISA)  

Bascially, it is the language through which we communicate with the computers. If u want a c program to run on particular layout, we need to follow a particular flow to pass the information from c program to layout.

 ```Compilation from software to Hardware : C Program - Assembly language(RISC-V) - Machine language format(binary Format) - Layout (executed as per requirement)```
 
 For this to be executed, we need a separate interface between the architecture and the layout called Hardware description language. We need to implement the architecture using RTL and PnR converts RTL to Layout(GDS) and we get this layout as output.

lets us take Apps as examples.
how apps runs on the hardware? Between the apps and hardware, system software is where the implementation takes place. The Major components in system software are **OS,Complier,Assembler.**

**OS        :**  Handles IO operations, allocation of memory. It converts the App into its corresponding assmebly language program and then to binary language. The o/p of OS ais low level system functions i.,e C,C++,JAVA.

**Complier  :** The system functions is then given to the complier which converts into set of instructions depending upon the hardware.

**Assembler :** The instruction sets are then converted to binary language and fed to hardware.

This set of instructions is`` INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE or ARCHITECTURE OF COMPUTER `` and acts as interface between compliers input and hardware. RTL is implemented using this instruction set and synthesize to gate level netlist and then to layout.


# SOC DESIGN USING OPENLANE

## Components of Opensource Digital ASIC Design

Digital ASIC Design in a automated way requires several elements. The elements are
- RTL (Hardware descrption language) Models
- EDA Tools
- PDK Data

we know about RTL and EDA tools. lets talk about PDK data.

**PDK data (Process Design Kit) :** In order to model a fabrication process for the EDA tools we need collection of files. These are included in that kit. It is the interface between designers and fabrication team.
PDK has Design rules, Device models, Digital Standard cell Libraries,I/O lib etc. 

Google worked on an aggreement with skywater to opensoure PDK for the 130nm process by skywater. Google released the first ever opensoure pdk. The pdk has only data information for successful ASIC implementation by openroad or ocla tools

Few Opensources for these three components are 
 
 ```
 RTL Designs :
 librecores.org
 opecores.org
 github.com
 
 EDA Tools :
 Qflow
 OpenROAD
 OpenLANE
 
 PDK DATA
 Google +skywater 130nm
 
 ```

## Simplified RTL2GDS Flow

**Synthesis                     :**  converting RTL into gate level netlist using standard cell libraries.

**FloorPlanning & PowerPlanning :**  Size and shape of the die, Macro placement, I/O pins are done in FP
power Grid is build and through rings,stripes and rails power is evenly distributed. Upper metal layers are used for power routing because of  more width, indeed less resistance so less IR drop and Electron migration

**Placement                     :** According to the netlist through coarse placement, cells are placed in their resepctive locations and cells might overlap.
so we do detailed placement to avoid the overlapping and flipped to save site row area.

**Clock Tree Synthesis          :** Building a clock tree such that clock reached every clock pin of a sequential block with min skew and insertion delay. 

**Routing                       :** After clock, Signal routing takes place. For each metal layer PDK defines thickness, pitch,width, tracks etc.
**SKY130 has 6 layers. The lowest layer is used for interconnects and is made of titanium nitride and all 5 layers are aluminium.**
Most routers are grid routers and metal tracks form a routing grid. since the grid is huge, we use divide and conquer approach.

**Global Routing   :** performed using coarse grained grids generating routing guides. 

**Detailed Routing :** Fine grained grids uses these routing gudies and impplement the actual routing between wires.

Once Routing is done, we do verifictaion during signoff

- **Physical verification :**  
      Design rule checks (DRC) : verifies whether our design meets design rules. (performed by MAGIC)
      Layout vs schematic (LVS) : verifies whether our layout matches with the netlist schematic.(MAGIC AND NETGEN)
- **Timing Verification :**
      Static Timing Analysis : Checks whether our design meets all teh timing constraints and is running with the designated frequency.

## INTRODUCTION TO OPENLANE and STRIVE Chipsets

When using opensource EDA tools, the problem becomes tougher. We need to worry about 
- Tools qualification 
- Tools calibration 
- Missing tools

By releasing OpenLANE PDK, **efabless** decided On creating reference **open source ASIC implementation methodology and flow called **OpenLANE FLOW**. It comes with **APACHE 20. version license**. 

**OpenLANE** has started for true **open-source Tape-out experiment**.

At efabless, family of **open everything SOC's** is called **striVe**.

The members of striVe SOC family
- striVe
- striVe 2, striVe 2a
- striVe 3, striVe3a
- striVe 5
- striVe 6.

Main goal of OpenLANE Asic flow is to have clean GDSII with out any human intervention(no-human-in-loop).
Clean GDSII implies
- No DRC violations
- No LVS violations
- Timing Violations (still work in progress)

It is Tuned for SkyWater 130nm Open PDK.

Can be used to Harden MAcros and Chips ( harden means generate the layout)

Two Modes of operation:
- Autonomous - Push button flow
- Interactive - manually by flow

OpenLANE has Design SPace Exploration which finds the best set of flow configurations

OpenLANE hhas 43 designs with their best configurations.

![image](https://github.com/sindhuk95/openLANE_sky130_PD_workshop_day1/assets/135046169/26160bdb-9d2b-47af-93c1-34f65b3c47a3)


The flow starts with RTL synthesis and ends with final layout in the GDS format.
OpenLANE is based on several OpenSOurce projects such as:
  - OpenROAD
  - Magic VLSI Layout Tool
  - QFlow
  - ABC
  - Fault
  - KLayout
  - Yosys.

Explaining how the flow works:

**RTL** is fed to ***YOSYS*** with the design constraints and translates into netlist then ***optimised and mapped*** into the synthesizable cells from Standard cell libraby using ***ABC***. ABC is used during optimization. 
**Synthesis exploration: When it comes to OpenLANE we have stratagies where some tragets least area and the other on best timing, this is called SYNTHESIS EXPLORATION.

**DESIGN EXPLORATION :**  When you have more no of configurations in our design, the Design exploration does sweeping job and gives an design matrix which has report on violations, cell count, runtime, utilization etc and from that we can get the best set of configurations and clean layout.

**OpenLANE REGRESSION Testing :** The design exploration utility is used for regression testing. OpenLANE already does this so that we can run the experssions on serveal configurations and compare them with the best one. It is something like Iteration.

DFT (DESIGN FOR TEST) : Its an additional testing that is done for correctness of the design by generating test vectors or stimulus. 
- Scan Insertion
- Automatic Test Pattern Generation(ATPG)
- Test Patterns Compaction
- Fault coverage
- Fault simulation

**Physical Implentation :** Implementation is done by OpenROAD APP. we use automated PnR 
- Floor/power planning
- End decoupling capcitors and Tap cells insertion
- PLacement : global and detailed
- Post placement optimization
- Clock Tree Synthesis
- Routing : Global and Detailed

**Logic Equivalence Check :** Since, we do optomization in Physical Implementation, the output netlist from this might be different from the synthesis netlist. Inorder to avoid any further violations functionally, we need to logically check the design before and after PnR. This is known as Logic Equivalence check

**Antenna Rule Violation :** When a metal wire segment is fabricated and its long enough, it act as antenna and collect charges which can damage the transistor  gate that is connected to that wire.
so length of the wire must be limited. Usually this job is done by router, if he fails, there are 2 solutions.

1. **Bridging :** In this we bridge using top layer so we go upto the top layer and drop back to to the metal layer that has long wire segment.
2. **Antenna diode :** Insert the diode next to the transistor that is getting effected by this long wire.

Using OpenLANE we took a preventive approach. we created a fake antenna diode and placed next to every cell during placement. when Magic runs for antenna checkers on the routed layout and reports a violation on a cell input pin, then replace the fake with the real one.

Signoff in openLANE STA is done by openSTA

- physical signoff includes DRC and LVS
- Magic is used for DRC and spice extraction from layout
- Magic and Netgen are used for LVS
- extracted spice by magic vs verilog netlist

# Getting Familiar to OpenSource EDA Tools

## OpenLANE Directory Structure 

- OpenLANE is a flow that comprises of OpenSource tools
- This flow goal is to implement RTL2GDS without human in loop.

Before using linux, commands that we use regularly are

```
cd : change directory, cd .. : change one driectory back
ls -ltr : lists everything in chronological order
cp : copy
clear - clears the screen not delete the content
less : to view a file 
vi : to view and write into the file (or) vim : to view or write into the file
When you open the file to edit, First press esc then i for inserting into the file(edit) and once done with editing press esc again and give
:wq : save write and exit.
:q : just quit
If I want to search anything in  vi or vim editor, use 
/ - searches  the word in the file EX: /sky130_vsdinv - this searches sky130_vsdinv in the entire file. If you have more than one, press n in the vi or vim editor to know the other locations of the search word.
very very important one is ( I felt it important)
find . -name filename - finds the cell in that directory or sub directories. This is just once, may more are available.
If you want to know the usage of the command, just type command --helo
Ex : rm --help
```

The directory which we will be using for entire implementation and invoking of the tool

`` /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane ``

Next comes process related files i.e., is pdk file.

Foundary files are made compatible only with commerical EDA tools. OpenPDKS has mitigated ths issue by implementing scripts and files that convert these foundary level PDKS to be compatible with OpenSource EDA Tools.

In pdks directory .we have one of such variant file  ``sky130A``. 

In this we have libs folder, which has information specific to process technology and tools.

![image](https://github.com/sindhuk95/openLANE_sky130_PD_workshop_day1/assets/135046169/ff0267b3-8345-483f-bbb9-3b3ba12178ad)


``sky130_fd_sc_hd`` variant is used for our design ``picorv32a``

Its abbreviation is:
 - sky130 : the process name, 130nm
 - fd     : foundry name of skywater. For example,  OSU is for oklahoma state university
 - sc     : standard cell
 - hd     : high density, variant of PDK

In this folder, we have lib files that has Timing related information like Process corners, PVT corners and lef and tech lef has physical information of cells.

## DOCKER, Package and Interactive Mode 

Before invoking the tool, lets know about **DOCKER**

When a developer develops a machine,its works fine in his system. But when its given to serves or someone else computers even with same performance or optimization, it wont work properly like images are not loaded properly or path is a little bit different. So, the classic problem between developer and production team is `` it works on my machine Why not in yours? , you might not have included the dependencies ``and this debt goes on. For this compatible issues, DOCKER was implemeneted. Docker is compatible with any programming language or project. Our code is wrapped in airtight containers which are portable.

**Docker is a tool which is used to automate the deployement applications in a light weight containers so the application can work effeciently in different enviroments.
 Container is a package that has all the dependencies required to run an application.**
 
 run `` docker`` 
 Once you run this, bash shell opens and we continue our OpenLANE Flow in that

Now, its time to use OpenLANE Flow. Since **OpenLANE is automatic, every stage runs automatically.** To know manually what is happening in each and every stage, we use **OpenLANE in interactive mode** and the flow.tcl has all the information about openlane flow.  

``./flow.tcl -interactive ``


![Capture](https://github.com/sindhuk95/openLANE_sky130_PD_workshop_day1/assets/135046169/f0c88fac-963c-41e8-a613-5a38adcfc4d3)


**package** typically contains related programs that can perform different functions. So, input all the packages that are required for the openlane.

``package require openlane 0.9``

Before synthesis, we need to prepare the setup the data structure for our design ``picorv32a``.
We have only three files in our design. Now, we create a file system to flow where each amd every step of flow will be fetching data from a particular created location (``runs``)

## Design Preparation step

``prep -design picorv32a`` 

![image](https://github.com/sindhuk95/openLANE_sky130_PD_workshop_day1/assets/135046169/c48ae1ae-6c87-46c7-aa25-9faa25387aaa)


A sub folder ``run`` has been created in picorv32a.

As you can clearly see the lefs are being merged from sky130A lef files.

![image](https://github.com/sindhuk95/openLANE_sky130_PD_workshop_day1/assets/135046169/4269ab29-6467-43e5-9199-db62416646df)

## Syntnesis run and Flop ratio

Now, ``run_synthesis``

After synthesis, we need to calculate the flop ratio, from the statistics report

![image](https://github.com/sindhuk95/openLANE_sky130_PD_workshop_day1/assets/135046169/b1781f83-ce0c-4a67-851f-0883b34a0dd2)

flop ratio = (no of flops)/(total no of cells).

dfxtp2 = 1613
no of cells = 18036
so flop ratio = 0.08943 or 8.943%

# DAY 2 Floorplan and Introcution to Library Cells

# Floorplanning considerations

   Few considerations are made before running floorplan. Key parameters are Aspect ratio, Utilization factors, Macro placement using  ```Macro Guide lines```, I/O pin  and Pre-placed cell placement and generating power grid. But In this OpenLANE flow, Power Grid generation comes after post-cts.So, lets take about power grid feneration after post-cts.

## Utilization Factor & Aspect Ratio  

When it comes to floorplanning, the shape and size of the fllorplan is decided by Aspect Ratio and how good the floor plan is decided by Utilisation Factor. They are defined as follows:

``` Utilisation Factor =  (Area occupied by netlist)/(total Area of the core)```
                   
``` Aspect Ratio = (height/width) ```

A Utilisation Factor of 1 signifies 100% utilisation leaving no place for routing and extra logic. However, In real scenario, the Utilisation Factor will usually be  0.5-0.6 ie., 50 to 60% of the area is used for macros, standard cells and rest is used for routing, extralogic. Likewise, an Aspect ratio of 1 signifies that the chip is square shaped. Any value other than 1 signifies rectanglular chip.

## Pre-placed cells 

Once the Utilisation Factor and Aspect Ratio has been decided, the locations of pre-placed cells need to be defined. lets say we have  a combinational logic which does some function, maybe clock buffers, complex cells like clock gating cell, mux, memory. so these cells are implemented separately. Pre-placed cells are IPs and have user defined locations hence are fixed in those locarions. Since they are placed before automated placement and routing, they are called pre-placed cells.

## Decoupling capacitors

Once we place Pre-placed cells, these must be surrounded with decoupling capacitors (decaps). lets say we have logic cell that needs transition. The capcitor demands a huge current and this is provided by the power supply through physical wires. As we know, Physical wires have resistance, capaictance and inductance in it. when the signal/supply voltage travserse through these long wires, they will be voltage drop and the intende supply cannot reach the logic cell that is transitioning.The voltage can lead to undefined region in noise margin. To avoid this, Decaps are invented. These are placed very close to the critical cells.  Decaps are fully charged and have equivalent voltage as of the power supply. Since Decap is close to the logic, its hard for the voltage to drop and the lies with in the Noise Margin range. Their role is to decouple the circuit from power supply by supplying the necessary amount of current to the circuit. They pervent crosstalk.

## Power Planning

As we know, there are millions of cells in our design and its hard to supplu power equally to all over the design. However we cannot place decaps cells everywhere in the design.  So, separate horizontal and vertical Vdd and Vss wires have been created forming like a mesh. Now, each cell can tap the required supply from the nearest wire. They way the power is supplied to all the standara cells is through rings,stripes and followpins.

## Pin Placement

The netlist is the logical connectivity between cells. The area between the core and die is utilised for placing I/O pins. The connectivity information is defined in either VHDL or Verilog and is used to determine the position of I/O pins of various ports. Then, logical cell placement is bloackage is done inorder to avoid any cells getting placed by automated PnR.

## Floorplan run on OpenLANE & review layout in Magic

**Floorplan envrionment variables or switches:**
1. ```FP_CORE_UTIL``` - core utilization percentage
2. ```FP_ASPECT_RATIO``` - the cores aspect ratio
3. ```FP_CORE_MARGIN``` - The length of the margin surrounding the core area
4. ```FP_IO_MODE``` - defines pin configurations around the core(1 = randomly equidistant/0 = not equidistant)
5. ```FP_CORE_VMETAL``` - vertical metal layer where I/O pins are placed
6. ```FP_CORE_HMETAL``` - horizontal metal layer where I/O pins are placed
 
***Note: Usually, the parameter values for vertical metal layer and horizontal metal layer will be 1 more than that specified in the files***

**Importance files in increasing priority order:**
1. ```floorplan.tcl``` - System default settings
2. ```conifg.tcl```
3. ```sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl```
 
 To run the picorv32a floorplan in openLANE:
 
 ```
 run_floorplan
 
 ```
 
Post the floorplan run, a .def file will have been created within the ```results/floorplan``` directory. We may review floorplan files by checking the ```floorplan.tcl.``` The system defaults will have been overriden by switches set in conifg.tcl and further overriden by switches set in ```sky130A_sky130_fd_sc_hd_config.tcl.```

To view the floorplan, Magic is invoked after moving to the results/floorplan directory:

```
magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def

```


One can zoom into Magic layout by selecting an area with left and right mouse click followed by pressing "z" key.

Various components can be identified by using the what command in tkcon window after making a selection on the component.

Zooming in also provides a view of decaps present in picorv32a chip.

The standard cell can be found at the bottom left corner.

You can clearly see I/O pins, Decap cells and Tap cells. Tap cells are placed in a zig zag manner or you can say diagonally


![image](https://github.com/sindhuk95/openLANE_sky130_PD_workshop_day1/assets/135046169/3a55d83e-1776-4b96-a55c-f1cf00d823bb)


# Library Binding and Placement

## Netlist Binding and initial place design

First we need to bind the netlist with physical cells. We have shapes for OR, AND and every cell for pratice purpose. But in reality we dont have such shapes, we have give an physical dimensions like rectangles or squares weight and width. This information is given in libs and lefs. Now we place these cells in our design by initilaising it. 

## Optimize Placement

The next step is placement. Once we initial the design, the logic cells in netlist in its physical dimisoins is placed on the floorplan. Placement is perfomed in 2 stages:

Global Placement: Cells will be placed randomly in optimal positions which may not be legal and cells may overlap. Optimization is done through reduction of half parameter wire length.
Detailed Placement: It alters the position of cells post global placement so as to legalise them.
Legalisation of cells is important from timing point of view.

Optimization is stage where we estimate the lenght and capictance, based on that we add buffers. Ideally, Optimization is done for better timing.

## Congestion aware Placement 

Post placement, the design can be viewed on magic within results/placement directory:

```
magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def

```


**Note: Power distribution network generation is usually a part of the floorplan step. However, in the openLANE flow, floorplan does not generate PDN.  It is created after post CTS. The steps are - floorplan, placement, CTS, Post CTS and then PDN**

## Need for libraries and characterization

As we know, From logic synthesis to routing and STA, each and evry stage has one thing in common i.e., logic gates/ logic cells. In order for the tool understand these gates are and their timing, we need to characterize these cells. 

# CELL DESIGN AND CHARACETRIZATION FLOWS

Library is a place where we get information about every cell. It has differents cells with different size, functionality,threshold voltages. There is a typical cell design flow steps.
1. Inputs : PDKS(process design kit) : DRC & LVS, SPICE Models, library & user-defined specs.
2. Design Steps :Circuit design, Layout design (Art of layout Euler's path and stick diagram), Extraction of parasitics, Characterization (timing, noise, power).
3. Outputs: CDL (circuit description language), LEF, GDSII, extracted SPICE netlist (.cir), timing, noise and power .lib files

## Standard Cell Characterization Flow

A typical standard cell characterization flow that is followed in the industry includes the following steps:

1. Read in the models and tech files
2. Read extracted spice Netlist
3. Recognise behavior of the cells
4. Read the subcircuits
5. Attach power sources
6. Apply stimulus to characterization setup
7. Provide neccesary output capacitance loads
8. Provide neccesary simulation commands

Now all these 8 steps are fed in together as a configuration file to a characterization software called GUNA. This software generates timing, noise, power models.
These .libs are classified as Timing characterization, power characterization and noise characterization.


# TIMING CHARACTERIZATION

In standard cell characterisation, One of the classification of libs is timing characterisation.

## Timing threshold definitions 
Timing defintion |	Value
-------------- | --------------
slew_low_rise_thr	| 20% value
slew_high_rise_thr | 80% value
slew_low_fall_thr |	20% value
slew_high_fall_thr |	80% value
in_rise_thr	| 50% value
in_fall_thr |	50% value
out_rise_thr |	50% value
out_fall_thr | 50% value

## Propagation Delay and Transition Time 

**Propagation Delay** 
The time difference between when the transitional input reaches 50% of its final value and when the output reaches 50% of its final value. Poor choice of threshold values lead to negative delay values. Even thought you have taken good threshold values, sometimes depending upon how good or bad the slew, the dealy might be still +ve or -ve.

```
Propagation delay = time(out_thr) - time(in_thr)
```
**Transition Time**

The time it takes the signal to move between states is the transition time , where the time is measured between 10% and 90% or 20% to 80% of the signal levels.

```
Rise transition time = time(slew_high_rise_thr) - time (slew_low_rise_thr)

Low transition time = time(slew_high_fall_thr) - time (slew_low_fall_thr)
```
